# Ecosyste.ms

[Ecosyste.ms](https://ecosyste.ms) provides a set of free and open resources for those working to sustain and secure open-source software. We publish open data and APIs that map software interdependencies, offering insights into usage, creation, and impact. Ecosyste.ms serves as infrastructure for researchers, policymakers, developers, and funders to build upon.

Ecosyste.ms combines data from package registries, software repositories, vulnerability databases, containers, and operating systems. This comprehensive view helps identify critical software ecosystems that form the backbone of our digital infrastructure.

To find out more about what we're building, check out our [roadmap](https://github.com/ecosyste-ms/roadmap).
