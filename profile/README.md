[Ecosyste.ms](http://Ecosyste.ms) presents open datasets and APIs that perform dependency mapping (i.e. identifying key software systems where open source software is critical) of the OSS ecosystem to determine which projects are most critical and most in need of support. 

The project builds on the ideas of an earlier tool [libraries.io](http://libraries.io/), but focuses more on expanding available data and APIs to take it to the next level. This tool provides a foundational basis for researchers to better analyze OSS and for funders to better prioritize which projects most need to be funded.

## Goals

- A comprehensive set of APIs for parsing and querying open source package manager metadata from across many software ecosystems
- Up-to-date, easily accessible open data for each software ecosystem
- Individual open source services that can be deployed or consumed for a variety of use cases related to the sustainability of open source software.
